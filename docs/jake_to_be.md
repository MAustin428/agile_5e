# AGILE CRAP :: TO BE 2/1/2021
## Background / Problem Statement
People don't always know where their dog craps, so they can't up after it. 

## MVP Scope
To solve the above problem with people not knowing where their dog craps, we will create a dog crap tracking system that will:
- Identify likely locations for where a dog craps
- Notify the owner using a crap map
- Allow for for integration with mobile apps and social media platforms for dog owners and other users

## Assumptions
None at this time

## High Level Requirements
The dog crap tracking system shall:
- Identify likely locations for where a dog craps
- Be inexpensive (less than about $100 to the end user)
- Be durable enough to last at least 2 years with normal use
- Be waterproof and weatherproof
- Be easy to set up
- Require minimal hardware in addition to the dog collar itself
- Utilize existing technology as much as possible
- Have adequate battery life (require charging less than once per day)
- Be rechargeable
- Have replaceable batteries (optional)
- Should be compatible with Android and Apple mobile devices
- Utilize user data (both actively input and passively gathered) to improve tracking

The dog crap tracking system's design should prioritize:
- Sleek and visually appealing hardware and software
- Social media involvement for dog owners and other users
- Partnerships with other dog and pet brands
- The potential to accessorize
- Subscription-based memberships and app designs

Data that may feed into the dog crap tracking system may include:
- Position
- Timing and duration
- Motion-sensing
- Tilt
- Weather (precipitation, temperature, etc.)

Above all, the dog crap tracking system should be:
- Useful
- Not rely on shady business practices

## Open Questions
Hardware solution?
Software solution?
Business solution/scope?
Legal issues (patents, wireless technology, reuse of existing technology, registering a company, liability, etc.)?
Many other things?
