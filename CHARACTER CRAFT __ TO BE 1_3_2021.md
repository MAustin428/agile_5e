# CHARACTER CRAFT :: TO BE 1/3/2021
## Background / Problem Statement
In Dungeons and Dragons, the character sheet is used to record information about the player character's statistics, equipment, and progress towards improvement. 
Traditionally, this is done with pencil on a printed template, which brings about problems associated with single-source physical documents. For example, as the character improves, the player will have to erase and re-write numbers frequently. 

## MVP Scope
To solve the above problems with a physical character sheet, we want a digital character sheet that will empower the user to:
- Set
- Store
- Update

all relevant character attributes and retrieve them at a later date. 
In future iterations, we can add logic to automate calculations for derived fields.

The current sheet looks like this:

We will create a webpage that will act as a persistent, digital character sheet.

## Assumptions
Maintaining fifth edition character sheet (not other versions, or other games) will support most players for the foreseeable future. 
Lists of existing character data will meet reasonable data size expectations.
Will only need to support material from base D&D lists (Player Handbook and DM guide).
