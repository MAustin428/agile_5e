# DOCUMENTATION
Document Character Craft code below, or with your preferred text editor in Markdown syntax (file extension is .md). Helpful syntax guide [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax).  
This way, changes to documentation can be pulled with everything else. 
I will produce any user-facing documentation (if required) from this file also.  
I know this is a pretty lightweight program that won't require a lot of documentation, but it's a good habit to form, and we can apply CI/CD workflows in the future.
